Description: The goal of biplotEZ is to provide users an EZ-to-use platform for
             visually representing their data with biplots. Currently, this package
             includes principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical variate
             analysis (CVA) biplots. This is accompanied by various formatting
             options for the samples and axes. Alpha-bags and concentration ellipses
             are included for visual enhancements and interpretation.
